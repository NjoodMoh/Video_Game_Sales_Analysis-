# Design 
This project is one of the T5 Data Science Boot Camp requirements. Data provided by Kaggle & data. world have been used in this project. In this module, we will be laying the foundation for our analysis by processing and exploring a large amount of data on video game sales. The dataset contains information regarding the sales of video games across various regions like North America, Europe, Japan and globally, while also giving information regarding the Names, Publishers and Platforms. This dataset has been made available thanks to Kaggle which is the home for many such datasets and competitions. Get the data here.

You are a data scientist in the gaming industry and want to analyze the sales pattern for different features. You want to investigate different features and approach the game producer with a thorough report. You want to find the answers to the following questions:

1. Which genre  has the higest sales globally ?
2. What are the top 5 platform for different regions?
3. What are the top 5 Platform making the most sales globally?
